# Logistic Regression: Age vs Insurance Purchase üìä

This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a person is likely to purchase insurance based on their age. The model is implemented using Python, and the data visualization is done with matplotlib.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `insurance_logistic_model.ipynb` ‚Äì Jupyter notebook containing the complete code (data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and plotting).
- `age_insurance_data.csv` *(if any)* ‚Äì Dataset used for the model.
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project documentation.

## üß† Objective

To predict the **probability** of purchasing insurance using logistic regression based on a person‚Äôs age.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Logistic regression from `sklearn.linear_model`
- Prediction probabilities with `.predict_proba()`
- Clean visualization of logistic curve
- Simple dataset and minimal dependencies

## üìä Visualization

Red "+" markers show actual data (age vs insurance purchase), and the blue curve represents the predicted probability of buying insurance.

Let me know if:
- You want a GitHub repo name tailored to your username.
- You want me to generate an `assets/` folder preview image like the logistic curve graph.
- You want to deploy or publish it somewhere (e.g. blog, portfolio).

I can also generate the required `.gitignore`, LICENSE, or `requirements.txt` if needed.
